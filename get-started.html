        <!-- Description of the ISKOpe system -->
        <p>
            Welcome to ISKOpe, a lost and found platform designed exclusively for the students of Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Manila. Inspired by the Filipino term “iskolar,” representing PUP scholars, and “scope,” meaning to search or look, ISKOpe reflects its mission to assist students in locating and reclaiming their valuables.

        <p>
            At ISKOpe, we understand how common it is to misplace personal belongings on a bustling university campus. With that, ISKOpe is created to be an accessible and user-friendly system to help PUPians report, search, and recover lost items with ease. Beyond its practical purpose, ISKOpe promotes a sense of trust and responsibility within the university community, making it easier to reunite students with their belongings efficiently and responsibly.
