# ISKOpe

ISKOpe is a digital lost-and-found management system developed for the Polytechnic University of the Philippines – Manila. The project addresses the recurring issue of lost and found items on campus by providing a centralized platform where students can easily report, search for, and reclaim their belongings.

## Project Overview

The system allows students to securely register and log in using pre-filled student information, including name, student ID, contact number, and email address. Users can report lost items or post found items by providing details such as category, location, date, time, and optional photos to help with identification.

To make item retrieval easier, ISKOpe includes categorical search functionality that enables users to quickly browse and filter listings. An admin panel is also provided to allow moderators to manage reports and monitor user activity.
